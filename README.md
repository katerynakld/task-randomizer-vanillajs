# Task Randomizer

Task Randomizer is a small vanilla JavaScript app designed to help people get unstuck.

The app lets you add tasks you want (or need) to do, then randomly selects one for you to start with. By removing the decision-making step, it aims to reduce procrastination and task paralysis—especially common for people with ADHD or ADHD-like symptoms—while lightly gamifying everyday routines.

## The Idea

Decision fatigue is real. When everything feels equally important (or equally overwhelming), choosing *where to start* can be the hardest part.

Task Randomizer acts as an external decision-maker. You give it the options; it gives you a starting point. The randomness adds a small element of play, which can make routines feel less rigid and more approachable.

This is not a productivity system or a task manager replacement. It’s a nudge.

## Features

- Add custom tasks  
- Store multiple tasks at once  
- Randomly select a task with a single button click  
- Simple, distraction-free interface  
- Works entirely in the browser  

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript  

No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies.

## How It Works

1. Enter the tasks you want or need to do  
2. Click the randomize button  
3. Start with the task that appears  

That’s it. The app deliberately keeps the interaction minimal to avoid adding cognitive load.

## Why This Exists

Many productivity tools assume motivation comes *before* action. For a lot of people, especially those with ADHD, motivation often comes *after* starting.

Task Randomizer is built around that reality:

- Reduce choices  
- Lower the barrier to starting  
- Turn the first step into a small game instead of a mental debate  

## Accessibility & Design Notes

- Simple layout to avoid visual overwhelm  
- Clear buttons and readable text  
- No time pressure or penalties  

The goal is support, not stress.

## Possible Future Improvements

- Task categories or tags  
- Session-based “one task at a time” mode  
- Local storage persistence  
- Small rewards or streaks (optional and non-intrusive)  
- Accessibility enhancements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

Sometimes the hardest task is choosing one. This app exists to make that choice for you, so you can get moving.
